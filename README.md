# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Juan, 
Totally new to this world. I knew about the existence of GitHub and even downloaded things relating to 3D printing, which is one of my hobbies, but never created an account until now.
Just starting into Data Analysis.

Back here to practice a little more with branches.
The general situation in Europe is getting quite complicated with the second break-out of the Covid-19.
